        <p class="text-muted text-left">Bali (/ˈbɑːli/; Balinese: ᬩᬮᬶ) is a province of Indonesia and the westernmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands. East of Java and west of Lombok, the province includes the island of Bali and a few smaller neighbouring islands, notably Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan, and Nusa Ceningan. The provincial capital, Denpasar,[7] is the most populous city in the Lesser Sunda Islands and the second-largest, after Makassar, in Eastern Indonesia. The upland town of Ubud in Greater Denpasar is considered Bali's cultural centre. The province is Indonesia's main tourist destination, with a significant rise in tourism since the 1980s.[8] Tourism-related business makes up 80% of its economy.[9]

Bali is the only Hindu-majority province in Muslim-majority Indonesia, with 86.9% of the population adhering to Balinese Hinduism.[3] It is renowned for its highly developed arts, including traditional and modern dance, sculpture, painting, leather, metalworking, and music. The Indonesian International Film Festival is held every year in Bali. Other international events held in Bali include the Miss World 2013 and 2018 Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group. In March 2017, TripAdvisor named Bali as the world's top destination in its Traveller's Choice award, which it also earned in January 2021.[10][11]

Bali is part of the Coral Triangle, the area with the highest biodiversity of marine species, especially fish and turtles.[12] In this area alone, over 500 reef-building coral species can be found. For comparison, this is about seven times as many as in the entire Caribbean.[13] Bali is the home of the Subak irrigation system, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[14] It is also home to a unified confederation of kingdoms composed of 10 traditional royal Balinese houses, each house ruling a specific geographic area. The confederation is the successor of the Bali Kingdom. The royal houses are not recognised by the government of Indonesia; however, they originated before Dutch colonisation.[15]

                <p class="p_modal">Diary of a Wimpy Kid is an American fiction book series and media franchise created by author and cartoonist Jeff Kinney.[1][2] The series follows Greg Heffley, a middle-schooler who illustrates his daily life in a diary.[3]

Kinney spent eight years working on the book before showing it to a publisher.[4] In May 2004, FunBrain and Kinney released an online version of Diary of a Wimpy Kid. The website made daily entries until June 2005.[5] The online version received almost 20 million views as of 2009. Nonetheless, many online readers requested a printed version. In February 2006, during the New York Comic Con, Kinney signed a multi-book deal with publisher Abrams Books to turn Diary of a Wimpy Kid into a print series.[4] The first installment was released in April 2007[5] to immediate success. In April 2009, Time magazine named Kinney to the Time 100 most influential people.[6]

Sixteen books in the series have been released as of 2021; an activity book has also been released. A spin-off series, centering on the character Rowley Jefferson, has three installments as of 2021.[7] The first, second, fourth and ninth installments have been adapted into films by 20th Century Fox;[8] two books have been released chronicling the production of the films.

Since the release of the online version in May 2004, most of the books have garnered positive reviews and commercial success. As of 2021, more than 250 million copies have been sold globally, making it the sixth best-selling book series of all time.[9].<br>
